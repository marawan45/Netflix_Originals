üé¨ Netflix Original Films & IMDb Scores - EDA
This project provides an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Netflix Original Films and their corresponding IMDb scores. The analysis aims to uncover trends, popular genres, language distributions, and the relationship between runtime and IMDb ratings for Netflix's original content.

üåü Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a dataset of Netflix original films, documentaries, and specials released as of June 1st, 2021. The primary goals include:

Understanding Content Landscape: Examining the distribution of films by genre, language, and release year.

Performance Analysis: Investigating the relationship between film attributes (runtime, genre, language) and IMDb scores.

Visualization: Creating insightful visualizations to present key findings.
